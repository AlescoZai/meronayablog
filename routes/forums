How can I start a PHP session?Give the syntax and example.
A PHP session is easily started by making a call to the session_start() function. The function first checks if a session is started and if no session is started then it starts one. It is mandatory to put the call to session_start() at the beginning of the page.

session_start() creates a session and restart the current one bases on a session identifier passed by a POST and GET method by a cookie.

Syntax:
bool sessio_start(void)

Inorder to create a session in PHP, first you need to call the PHP session_start function and then store your values in the $_SESSION array variable.

Code:

<?php
session_start(); //start the PHP_session function
if(isset($_SESSION['page_count']))
{
$_SESSION['page_count'] += 1;
}
else
{
$_SESSION['page_count'] = 1;
}
echo 'You are visitor number ' . $_SESSION['page_count'];
?>

You are visitor number 1

A PHP session can be destroyed by session_destroy() function. This PHP function doesn't need any argument and a single call can destroy all the session variables.If you want to destroy a single session variable then you can use unset() function to unset a session variable.

How to upload single and multiple files in PHP?
PHP allows you to upload single and multiple files through few lines of code. Php file upload features allows you to upload text and binary files both. Apart from this, you can have the full control over the file to be uploaded through PHP authentication  and the file operation funtions.
You can see the PHP file upload example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Upload your files</title>
</head>
<body>
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="upload.php" method="POST">
<p>Upload your file</p>
<input type="file" name="uploaded_file"></input><br />
<input type="submit" value="Upload"></input>
</form>
</body>
</html>
<?PHP
if(!empty($_FILES['uploaded_file']))
{
$path = "uploads/";
$path = $path . basename( $_FILES['uploaded_file']['name']);
if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploaded_file']['tmp_name'], $path)) {
echo "The file ". basename( $_FILES['uploaded_file']['name']). 
" has been uploaded";
} else{
echo "There was an error uploading the file, please try again!";
}
}
?>


What is PHP function?
A function is a block of code which can be called from any point in a script after it has been declared. Benefit of using PHP functions is that they can be reused many times. It can take input as argument list and return value. PHP comes with hundreds of ready made built in functions, making it a very rich language.

What are the advantages of using a PHP functions?
The advantages of using a PHP function are mentioned below:
Portable:
PHP can run for almost every server and most platforms. You can run it easily in Apache,IIS, etc. This means "written once run anywhere".

Cost:
PHP itself is free and the majority of items it works without the box(Apache, MySql) are free. This gives your project a very low initial cost threshold.

Code reusability:
PHP functions are defined once and can be invoked many times, like in other programming languages.

Easy to understand:
PHP functions understand the flow of the application because every logic is divided in the form of functions.


Write a simple PHP function.
Creating a PHP functions is very easy. Let's create two functions that will print the message "welcome to our website phphelp.net".While creating a function its name start with keyword function and all the PHP code shoud be inside the curley braces { and } as in example below:-

Code:
    <?php
        /* Defining a PHP Function */
         function writeMessage() {
         echo "Welcome to our website phphelp.net!";
         }
         /* Calling a PHP Function */
         writeMessage();
     ?>

Result:
welcome to our website phphelp.net! 

What is PHP Call By Value?
PHP allows you to call function by value and reference both. In case of PHP call by value, actual value is not modified if it is not modified inside the function.
See the example below:

<?php 
function msg($str1) 
{ 
    $str1 .= ‘This is phphelp.net’; 
} 
$str = 'Welcome '; 
msg($str); 
echo $str; 
?>

In this example, variable $str is passed to the msg function where it is concatenated with 'This is phphelp.net' string. But, printing $str variable results 'Welcome' only. It is because changes are done in the local variable $str1 only. It doesn't reflect to $str variable.

The above example gives the below result:
Welcome

What is PHP call by reference?
PHP call by reference allows you to override the normal scoping rules and give a function direct access to a variable. To be passed by reference, the argument must be a variable; you indicate that a particular argument of a function will be passed by reference by preceding the variable name in the parameter list with an ampersand(&).
Here, the variable $str is passed to the msg function where it is concatenated with 'Phphelp.net' string. Here, priting $str variable results 'Welcome Phphelp.net'. It is because changes are done in the actual variable $str.
Example:

<?php 
function msg(&$str1) 
{ 
   $str1 .= ‘Phphelp.net’; 
} 
$str = 'Welcome'; 
msg($str); 
echo $str; 
?>

Result:
Welcome Phphelp.net


What is PHP recursive function?
A recursive function is a function that calls itself again and again.
Recursion occurs when something contains, or uses a similar verison of itselt. In programming it happens when a function is having a call to itself.

You can see the below factorial problem:
5! = 5*4*3*2*1
   = 120

Example:
function fact($n) {
  if ($n === 0) { // our base case
    return 1;
  }
  else {
     return $n * fact($n-1); // calling itself again and again
  }
}
